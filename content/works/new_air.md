##### Program Note: 

In our first meeting about this piece, John Hallberg talked greatly about wanting to play something that was “a breath of fresh air.” This piece aims to capture exactly that - the feeling of taking in great breath of crisp and refreshing air at the turn of a new season; a playfulness that flows and whirls with its own lofty ideals.

Commissioned by John Hallberg and his consortium. More info at [https://www.john-hallberg.com/consortiums.html](https://www.john-hallberg.com/consortiums.html)
