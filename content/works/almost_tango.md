##### Program Note: 

     Almost, Tango is inspired by the drunken chatter, gossip, and chaos of a small social gathering. You watch and enjoy the crowd until eventually joining the sea of incoherent partygoers. After a confusing and surprising mix of events, the details of the evening are eventually lost and you are left with a swirling cloud of half-memories that are not necessarily what they seem.
