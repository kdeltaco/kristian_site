##### Program Note: 

(i am becoming) shades of myself  comes from a sense of exploration of self-identity. It is so simple to become caught up in the swirling masses and energies of one’s environment, and sometimes it’s worthwhile to take a few moments to reflect on how these experiences take effect, if at all.


This work was made possible by the [2022 Southern California New Works Initiative](https://scmarimba.org/new-music/) and the wonderful supporters of new music.
