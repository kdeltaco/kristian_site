##### Program Note: 

*Crystalline Structures* draws inspiration from the structure and formation of naturally forming crystals. Some crystals are formed in very even, cleanly splitting structures that can repeat indefinitely due to their molecular bond structures, while others exist without order and can shatter into jagged and irregular forms when under high amounts of heat and stress.

This work explores these concepts of tumultuous transformation that, while sometimes violent and brazen, can still result in something uniquely wonderful.

*Note: The full score features sound effects and aleatoric techniques that are not included in the MIDI Demo.*
