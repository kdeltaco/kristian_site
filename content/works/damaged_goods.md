##### Program Note: 

     Damaged Goods for Full Orchestra is inspired by recent deep internal metamorphoses in my personal life. Images of imperfect innocence collide with discordant turbulence, ebbing and flowing between chaos and order — a constantly cycling battle of shifting emotions affected by external circumstance and internal strife.
     Colored deeply by personal experience, this tone poem journals my thoughts as I shed weight from the past and move forward into a colorful present.
