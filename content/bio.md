Kristian de Leon is a Brooklyn-based composer and visual artist who aims to create colorful, imaginative works that explore the threads that connect our human condition. Blending elements of acoustic, electronic, and visual media, he creates immersive audio-visual and live collaborative performance works driven by the means of organic expressions in a digital medium. 

His recent projects include compositions for [acoustic-electric ensemble and dynamic lighting](/works/tone_color), works for creative [movement and adaptive fixed media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrGkwiDONIc), and [real-time visual synthesis](https://youtu.be/VlXKsHbAg6Q?si=hNQPuBdoIwQ2Ysua) for generative electronic music.

Kristian has written for several premiere ensembles and performance artists including JACK Quartet, Bergamot Quartet, and percussionist Lynn Vartan, and has worked closely with organizations including Brooklyn Motion Capture Dance Ensemble, Southern California Marimba, and the CSUF Wind Symphony. Currently, he performs collaboratively with audio-visual duo [Blank Aberration](https://www.blankaberration.com) and acoustic-electric trio Other Faces.

Kristian lives in Brooklyn, NY with his obscenely large house cat, Bagel, and holds a Masterâ€™s Degree in Music Theory and Composition at NYU Steinhardt.
