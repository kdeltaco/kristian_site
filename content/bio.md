Kristian de Leon is a Brooklyn-based composer and artist who aims to create colorful, imaginative works that explore the threads that connect our human condition. He focuses on blending elements of acoustic, electronic, and visual media, looking to find inventive ways to push past traditional conventions, fostering a new kind of connection to those who interact with his work. \
His recent projects include compositions for [acoustic-electric ensemble and dynamic lighting](/works/tone_color.md), works for creative [movement and adaptive fixed media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrGkwiDONIc), and [real-time visual synthesis](https://youtu.be/VlXKsHbAg6Q?si=hNQPuBdoIwQ2Ysua) for generative electronic music.

Kristian has written for a number of premiere performance artists and ensembles such as JACK Quartet, Bergamot Quartet, Hypercube Ensemble, Transient Canvas. He also has worked closely with individuals and organizations, including Southern California Marimba, Brooklyn Motion Capture Dance Ensemble, and the CSUF Wind Symphony, creating new works for different mediums ranging from traditional concert music to experimental live sound design.

Kristian is currently living in Brooklyn, NY with his obscenely large house cat, Bagel, and holds a Bachelor's degree in Percussion Performance from California State University, Fullerton, and a Masterâ€™s Degree in Music Theory and Composition at NYU Steinhardt under Michael Gordon, Shelley Washington, and Robert Honstein.
